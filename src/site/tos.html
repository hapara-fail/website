          <p>
            Welcome to hapara.fail. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website,
            tools, technical write-ups, and the public Domain Name System (DNS) service
            (collectively, the "Services"). Our mission is to provide information and tools for
            educational purposes and to advocate for student privacy. By accessing or using our
            Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>1. Description of Services</h2>
          <p>
            The hapara.fail project provides community-driven, open-source tools and a public DNS
            service designed to offer greater control over your network environment. The Services
            are intended to demonstrate how network-level filtering works and to provide a means for
            users to shield themselves from pervasive tracking and surveillance technologies,
            particularly in educational settings. All Services are provided free of charge and are
            for personal, non-commercial use.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>2. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Your use of the Services is contingent on your adherence to this Acceptable Use Policy.
            Failure to comply may result in the immediate and permanent termination of your access
            to the Services.
          </p>

          <h3>2.1 Prohibited Activities</h3>
          <p>
            You agree not to use the Services for any illegal, harmful, or malicious activities,
            including but not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Engaging in any activity that violates any applicable local, state, national, or
              international law or regulation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transmitting or accessing any material that is abusive, harassing, defamatory,
              fraudulent, or obscene.
            </li>
            <li>
              Attempting to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage, or disrupt any
              parts of the Services, our servers, or any network connected to the Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Distributing malware, viruses, or any other computer code, files, or programs that are
              designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or
              hardware.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2.2 Specific Terms for the hapara.fail DNS Service</h3>
          <p>
            The hapara.fail DNS is a free, shared resource provided for the community. You
            explicitly agree <strong>not</strong> to abuse this service. We stress that the DNS
            service is a community resource; actions that degrade the service for others, whether
            intentional or not, will be treated as abuse. Abuse includes, but is not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Commercial Use:</strong> You may not use the DNS service for commercial
              purposes, resell access, or integrate it into a paid product or service without our
              express written permission.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>High-Volume Queries:</strong> You may not send an excessive or unreasonable
              volume of DNS queries that could degrade the performance and availability of the
              service for other users. The service is not intended for high-traffic enterprise
              environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Malicious Traffic:</strong> You may not route traffic associated with
              denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, DNS amplification attacks, spamming, phishing, or
              other malicious network activities through our DNS resolvers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to monitor network traffic for signs of abuse and to block any IP
            address or range of addresses found to be in violation of these terms, without prior
            notice.
          </p>
        </div>

            <strong
              >We do not condone or encourage the use of our Services to violate applicable laws,
              regulations, or institutional policies (such as school Acceptable Use
              Policies).</strong
            >
            Any use of these Services to access unauthorized content or bypass network security

          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Limitation of Liability</h3>

            To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will hapara.fail, its contributors,

            of the Services.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>4. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any
            changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your
            continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the
            new Terms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>5. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your access to our Services, in our sole discretion, at any
            time and without notice to you, for any reason, including but not limited to your breach
            of these Terms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>6. Indemnification</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless hapara.fail, its maintainers, and
            contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses
            (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your
            access to or use of the Services, or your violation of these Terms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>7. Enforcement and Appeals Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to enforce these Terms by implementing technical measures,
            including but not limited to blocking IP addresses or ranges we determine are sources of
            abuse or malicious activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe your access to our Services has been restricted in error, you may appeal
            this decision. To file an appeal, please send an email to
            <strong><a href="mailto:support@support.hapara.fail">support@support.hapara.fail</a></strong> with the
            subject line "ToS Appeal". In the body of the email, please include your IP address, a
            brief description of the issue, and any information you believe is relevant to your
            case.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will review your appeal in good faith. However, we are under no obligation to reverse
            our decision, and all determinations made by our team are final. Appeals for clear and
            deliberate violations (such as participation in DDoS attacks) will be disregarded.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>8. Severability</h2>
          <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
            will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will
            otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
